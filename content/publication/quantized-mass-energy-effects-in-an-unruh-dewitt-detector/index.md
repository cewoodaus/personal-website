abstract: A simple but powerful particle detector model consists of a two-level
  system coupled to a field, where the detected particles are the field
  excitations. This is known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. Research using this
  model has often focused on either a completely classical description of the
  external degrees of freedom of the detector, or a full field-theoretic
  treatment, where the detector itself is described as a field. Recently there
  has been much interest in quantum aspects of the detector’s center of
  mass—either described as moving in superposition along semiclassical
  trajectories, or dynamically evolving under a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian.
  However, the processes of interest—the absorption or emission of field
  particles—necessarily change the detector’s rest mass by the amount of energy
  of the absorbed or emitted field quanta. Neither of the above models can
  capture such effects. Here we incorporate the quantization of the detector’s
  mass-energy into the Unruh-DeWitt model. We show that internal energy changes
  due to emission or absorption are relevant even in the lowest energy limit.
  Specifically, corrections to transition rates due to the detector’s mass
  changing cannot be ignored unless the entire center of mass dynamics is also
  ignored. Our results imply that one cannot have a consistent model of the
  Unruh-DeWitt detector as a massive particle without including the mass-energy
  equivalence.
