abstract: Composite particles—atoms, molecules, or microspheres—are unique tools
  for testing joint quantum and general relativistic effects, macroscopic limits
  of quantum mechanics, and searching for new physics. However, all studies of
  the free propagation of these particles find that they delocalize into
  separate internal energy components, destroying their spatial coherence. This
  renders them unsuitable for experimental applications, as well as theoretical
  studies where they are used as idealized test masses or clocks. Here we solve
  this problem by introducing a class of states with minimal uncertainty in
  spacetime that fully overcome the delocalization. The relevant physics comes
  from minimizing the uncertainty between position and velocity, rather than
  position and momentum, while directly accounting for mass as an operator. Our
  results clarify the nature of composite particles, providing a currently
  missing theoretical tool with direct relevance for studies of joint
  foundations of quantum and relativistic phenomena, which removes a roadblock
  that could limit near-future quantum tests using composite particles.
