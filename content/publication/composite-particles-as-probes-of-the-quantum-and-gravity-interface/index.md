  Composite quantum particles, such as atoms and molecules, are promising tools
  for probing quantum systems under gravitational effects. However, greater
  understanding of mass--energy equivalence in composite particles and their
  interactions with external environments is required.

  This thesis addresses this knowledge gap by 1) deriving semi-classical propagating states for such particles, 2) modelling generalised interactions between quantum systems and thermal environments, and 3) describing mass--energy effects in simple atom--light interaction models.

  Ther results stress that mass--energy equivalence is required to correctly model quantum particles with internal structure, particularly when the interplay between internal, external, and environmental degrees of freedom is crucial.
