title: "Small to Big: The limits of quantum physics"
abstract: "Quantum physics is weird, yet it underpins most of life and
  technology on Earth. How do we get to the familiar world we can see and touch
  from the world of quarks and atoms? Perhaps we can learn something from
  Einsteinâ€™s humble formula: E=mc^2."
