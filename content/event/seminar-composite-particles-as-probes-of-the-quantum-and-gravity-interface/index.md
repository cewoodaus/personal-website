title: "Seminar: Composite Particles as Probes of the Quantum-and-Gravity Interface"
abstract: >-
  Composite quantum particles, such as atoms and molecules, are promising tools
  for probing quantum systems under gravitational effects, particularly in
  non-relativistic settings. However, greater understanding of the effects of
  mass-energy equivalence in composite particles and their interactions with
  external environments is still needed.


  In this talk, I will present recent work which addressed this knowledge gap by deriving semi-classical propagating states for the above particles, and by modelling generalised interactions between quantum systems and external environments – in this case, a quantum field. I will discuss these results and show how they highlight the importance of mass--energy equivalence for correctly modelling quantum particles with internal structure—particularly when the interplay between internal, external, and environmental degrees of freedom is crucial—and discuss how they stretch our notions of what it means to work in the non-relativistic regime.
