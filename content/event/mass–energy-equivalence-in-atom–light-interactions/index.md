title: Mass–Energy Equivalence in Atom–Light Interactions
abstract: >-
  Results in atomic physics show that mass–energy equivalence plays a crucial
  role in energy and momentum

  conservation for atom–light interactions: absorption or emission of field quanta must also change

  the atom’s rest mass by an equivalent energy. Though the Unruh–DeWitt (UDW) detector model of a

  quantum particle interacting with an external environment is powerful in its simplicity, the dominant

  model—which assigns the detector a classical trajectory and treats only the internal state as a quantum

  DOF—cannot capture the above mentioned effects.

  Here I present a new model which leverages the simplicity of the UDW model while also incorporating

  quantisation of the detector’s mass-energy to allow mass changes due to emission/absorption. I show

  that these relativistic effects persist even at low energies and cannot be ignored unless all centre of mass

  dynamics is ignored. I will then present further results discussing effects that arise when such a detector’s

  ground and excited states are in superposition, where the detector acts as a quantum clock.
