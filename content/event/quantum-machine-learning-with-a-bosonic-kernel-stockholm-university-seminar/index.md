title: Quantum Machine Learning With a Bosonic Kernel Stockholm University Seminar
abstract: >-
  Kernel methods are of current interest in quantum machine learning due to
  similarities shared with quantum computing in how information is processed in
  high-dimensional feature (Hilbert) spaces. Quantum kernels are believed to
  offer particular advantages when they are hard to simulate classically. Kerr
  nonlinearity---already a known route to universal continuous variable quantum
  computation---is hence a strong source of nonclassicality for machine
  learning.


  In this talk, I will begin with a brief introduction to quantum machine learning as a whole, and kernel methods, before discussing the analytical form of a kernel which exploits the analogue features of Kerr-coupled modes---and could be implemented on quantum hardware (such as superconducting circuits). Measurements, such as one would make via displaced parity operators in a physical system, effectively produce different Wigner functions for the same synthetic data set, and comprise a labelling scheme which can be used as the basis of a simple classification training task. I will discuss the performance of a classification algorithm called a support vector machine using our Kerr kernel, and compare it to the performance of a standard classical kernel.
