title: Composite particles as probes of the quantum-and-gravity interface
abstract: >-
  Composite quantum particles, such as atoms and molecules, are promising tools
  for probing quantum systems under gravitational effects. However, greater
  understanding of mass—energy equivalence in composite particles and their
  interactions with external environments is still needed.


  In this talk, I will present recent work which addressed this knowledge gap by deriving semi-classical propagating states for the above particles, and by modelling generalised interactions between quantum systems and external environments – namely, quantum fields and thermal baths. I will discuss these results and show how they highlight the importance of mass--energy equivalence for correctly modelling quantum particles with internal structure, particularly when the interplay between internal, external, and environmental degrees of freedom is crucial.
