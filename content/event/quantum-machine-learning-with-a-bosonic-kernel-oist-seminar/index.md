title: Quantum Machine Learning With a Bosonic Kernel OIST Seminar
abstract: Kernel methods are of current interest in quantum machine learning due
  to similarities with quantum computing in how they process information in
  high-dimensional feature (Hilbert) spaces~\cite{Schuld2021}. Kernels are
  believed to offer particular advantages when they are hard to simulate
  classically, so a kernel with the right kind of complexity, or
  nonclassicality, is considered important. While these points have been
  extensively researched for discrete states such as qubits, relatively few
  works have considered them in the continuous variable regime. Kerr
  nonlinearities, already a known route to universal continuous variable (CV)
  quantum computation, are also a strong source of nonclassicality for machine
  learning.
