title: "Talk: Composite particles with minimum uncertainty in spacetime"
abstract: >-
  Composite particles such as atoms and molecules are promising tools for future
  experiments testing fundamental physics. However, as experiments advance in
  complexity and precision, the loss of spatial coherence is a problem which
  will only increase. In all theoretical studies of propagating composite
  particles, their internal energy components delocalise, and their spatial
  coherence is destroyed. This calls into question the suitability of composite
  particles as experimental tools, and is contrary to our understanding of atoms
  and molecules as cohesive entities with well-localised spacetime trajectories.

  Here, we show the optimal way to prepare composite particles to fully avoid the delocalization and related loss of spatial coherence. We find the correct approach needed to discuss limitations on the space-time trajectories of composite quantum particles: it requires a new uncertainty principle which includes mass as an operator. We show that the quantum states which minimise the inequality propagate coherently in spacetime, and transform covariantly under boosts. This result highlights the fundamental differences between phase and configuration space for composite particles, while the new minimum uncertainty states will find applications in upcoming precision experimental tests.
