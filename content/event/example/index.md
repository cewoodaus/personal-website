abstract: When thermodynamical quantities are associated with quantum systems a
  question arises how to treat scenarios where the notion of temperature could
  exhibit some quantum features. It is known that the temperature of a gas in
  thermal equilibrium is not constant in a gravitational field, but it is not
  known how a delocalised quantum system would thermalise with such a bath. In
  this theoretical work we demonstrate two scenarios in which the notion of a
  `superposition of temperatures' arises.
