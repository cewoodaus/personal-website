title: Comparing Superpositions of Classical and Quantum-CoM Detectors
abstract: >-
  Particle detector models are powerful tools for probing different quantum
  fields or spacetimes. The dominant model, the Unruhâ€“DeWitt (UDW) detector,
  describes a pointlike particle interacting with a quantum field along a
  classical trajectory, with only the particle's internal state treated as a
  quantum degree of freedom.


  Recent studies have moved to include more realistic quantum effects, describing standard UDW detectors in superpositions of classical trajectories, or upgrading the model to better capture the properties of physical systems such as atoms, with a quantised centre of mass (CoM) dynamically evolving under a non-relativistic Hamiltonian, and the introduction of mass-energy equivalence.


  In this work, we compare superpositions of the standard and quantum-CoM detector models, and explore under which limits and conditions one model can reasonably approximate the other. We indeed find regimes in which the quantum model approaches the classical, but also effects in the quantum-CoM case which the standard UDW model is not equipped to capture.
