[$\\LaTeX$](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a typesetting language for writing documents which is extensively used in the scientific fields. 

Carolyn first wrote this tutorial as a startup guide and introduction for undergraduate physics students at the University of Queensland while she was the president of the UQ physics club [PAIN](http://physics.uq.edu.au/pain/) in 2013.

Later members of the club added to the file, which now finds its home here.
