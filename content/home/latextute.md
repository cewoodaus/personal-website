[$\LaTeX$](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a document typesetting language which is extensively used in the scientific fields. 

This tutorial is intended as a startup guide and introduction for undergraduate students. I first wrote it during my tenure as president of the University of Queensland's physics club in 2013, and later club members added to the file.
